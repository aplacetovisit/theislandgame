##  Invader

The invaders always have a presence on the island, but will periodically congregate in such large numbers as to become a horde. Once the invaders reach horde status they tend to start laying waste to everything around them, up to an including Waterside and The Roost. Rockhome is the only islander stronghold to have never fallen to an invader horde.


### Undead

While the bulk of this horde is your run of the mill skeletons and zombies, almost all undead types are represented in the invasion force. There has never been a single leader or driving force behind the undead horde in the few times it has manifested and attacked the islanders.

### Underdark

Made up mostly of grimlock foot soldiers, the underdark horde also includes many other nasties. Derro, Drow, Duergar, and Fomorians make up some of the legions, while Beholders and Illithids are not unheard of. It is believe that the underdark horde is driven by the whispers of the dark gods of the deep.

### From the Ocean

Mostly made up of Sahuagin, the ocean horde also sees many Kuo-Toa that have been enslaved by the Sahuagin as well as a number of giant amphibious sea creatures.

### Hobgoblin

The most frequest horde is the hobgoblin legions. While they always are active in some form or another, the hobgoblin horde usually forms up when three or more legions of hobgoblins set out to raid. The foce is comprised of goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, ogres, and hill giants, but are primarily lead by hobgoblin commanders. If there is a unifying force behind all the hobgoblins it is unknown.

###  The Island Wolves

There are a number of 'tribes' of wolves that live throughout the island. Thanks to research from a vedalken druid it was discovered that they have banded into a nation of sorts. They don't care for the islanders and keep away from them for the most part. They are rumored to be capable of speech, but attempts to contact them have met with very little success. It is believed that a 'tribe' once inhabited the area of Rockhome, but was either chased out of killed off by islanders.

Island wolves have been known to mobilize war parties and defend their lands from invaders.


###  The Island Spiders

These monstrous spiders lay claim to pockets of dark forest and deep crags. Individual nests appear to be far apart, but some believe the island spiders work together. They are feared because of their venom and their intelligence. The spiders are known to capture and tend to livestock. They deposit their eggs into the cranial cavities of creatures they have subdued with their venom. These creatures have their brains slowly digested as the spider larvae grows. Some reports of 'zombies' have turned out to be victims of this process that have gone mad. Some believe that the spider young are capable of controlling the victims as they mature.


###  Monsters

While not really a faction, the abundance of monstrous entities on the island definitely act as an opposing force to the islanders. There appears to be no coordination amongst the many types of monsters on the island, but their constant presence and unpredictable nature makes life on the island very difficult.

Of special note are the giant bats and wasps of the woods. Most walkways in The Roost are protected by lattice work fences and grates to prevent people being knocked or snatched off by the giant flying menaces.
