###  The Island Wolves

There are a number of 'tribes' of wolves that live throughout the island. Thanks to research from a vedalken druid it was discovered that they have banded into a nation of sorts. They don't care for the islanders and keep away from them for the most part. They are rumored to be capable of speech, but attempts to contact them have met with very little success. It is believed that a 'tribe' once inhabited the area of Rockhome, but was either chased out of killed off by islanders.

Island wolves have been known to mobilize war parties and defend their lands from invaders.


###  The Island Spiders

These monstrous spiders lay claim to pockets of dark forest and deep crags. Individual nests appear to be far apart, but some believe the island spiders work together. They are feared because of their venom and their intelligence. The spiders are known to capture and tend to livestock. They deposit their eggs into the cranial cavities of creatures they have subdued with their venom. These creatures have their brains slowly digested as the spider larvae grows. Some reports of 'zombies' have turned out to be victims of this process that have gone mad. Some believe that the spider young are capable of controlling the victims as they mature.


###  Monsters

While not really a faction, the abundance of monstrous entities on the island definitely act as an opposing force to the islanders. There appears to be no coordination amongst the many types of monsters on the island, but their constant presence and unpredictable nature makes life on the island very difficult.

Of special note are the giant bats and wasps of the woods. Most walkways in The Roost are protected by lattice work fences and grates to prevent people being knocked or snatched off by the giant flying menaces.
