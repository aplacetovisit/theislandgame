The Island Government
---------------------

The island government is an obstuse and chaotic affair that still seems to follow very precise and codified laws. The three major towns are each run by a governor that is chosen once every ten years by the senators associated to those towns. These governors are considered to be the defacto leaders of the island with the other two towns giving deference to the governor of Rockhome in times of war making the governor of Rockhome the ranking executive. 

The role of governor amounts to a lot of logistical and operational duties and some strategic planning. While the governors are burdened with numerous obligations they often appoint delegates that are more experienced and specialized in certain areas to free them up to manage the overall situation. The most common of these delegates is a commander of military along with strategy and tactics roles for the defense of the settled lands.

The senate's three bodies are made up of racial, regional, and professional representatives, each elected to their bodies based on customs, laws, and or rituals upheld by the organizations or gatherings they represent. Senators are obligated to vote on matters before the legislative body, though the timing of these votes are given some leeway, specifically in times of war. Senators are also obligated to guarantee that all citizens they represent are given an opportunity to vote during the electoral period. 

The terms and limits of office are determined on a per case basis for each represented group or region, with the overall law of the land also allowing for a recall of any elected official believed to no longer faithfully represent their constituents.
